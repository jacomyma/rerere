# CSV Rinse Repeat - CSV grooming, the JS way

### The idea
You have a CSV and you need to transform it into a better CSV, which includes filtering, clustering, parsing, merging, (...) and matching regular expressions. Why not doing it in JS? You're welcome.

### Just use it
TODO: online version

### Installing

```sh
# install dependencies listed in bower.json
$ bower install
```

### Using
Browse to the ```app/``` directory, upload a CSV, add visualizations, code javascript.
